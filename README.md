# Interactive-Dashboard-Plotly-Heroku-App-for-Germ-Biodiversity

The purpose of this project was to build an interactive dashboard that would allow a user to explore a germ biodiversity dataset. This involved using plotly.js to build interactive charts. Charts included pie charts to display the top 10 samples of germs, a multidimensional bubble chart to display the frequency of particular germs, and metadata panel displayed from a JSON object. Finally, the app was deployed on Heroku.
